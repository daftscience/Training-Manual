NNSCFREVELE  & \_ : \_* Revised Report Notes *Revised Screening Result for Cystic Fibrosis. Additional testing using a CFTR 40 Mutation Panel has been performed. No further evaluation necessary unless clinically indicated. Although there is minimal risk for Cystic Fibrosis (CF) in the absence of detected mutations, an elevated immunoreactive trysinogen (IRT) result may be indicative of CF due to a mutation not included in the 40-mutation panel. Recommend sweat testing and possible genetic evaluation only if clinically indicated. [The specimen was originally reported as Indeterminate for Cystic Fibrosis showing Immunoreactive Trysinogen as Elevated. The original screening note read “Many unaffected infants have an elevated immunoreactive trysinogen (IRT) level on the first specimen.
